🔥 Running benchmarks with hyperfine...
Benchmark 1: ./build/lib.macosx-11.0-arm64/bench_flask
  Time (mean ± σ):       2.0 ms ±   1.2 ms    [User: 0.7 ms, System: 0.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):     0.3 ms …  12.9 ms    449 runs
 
  Warning: Command took less than 5 ms to complete. Note that the results might be inaccurate because hyperfine can not calibrate the shell startup time much more precise than this limit. You can try to use the `-N`/`--shell=none` option to disable the shell completely.
  Warning: Statistical outliers were detected. Consider re-running this benchmark on a quiet system without any interferences from other programs. It might help to use the '--warmup' or '--prepare' options.
 
Benchmark 2: ./bench_flask_go
  Time (mean ± σ):       5.2 ms ±   3.9 ms    [User: 1.6 ms, System: 1.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):     1.9 ms …  33.5 ms    336 runs

Benchmark 3: ./bench_flask_rust
  Time (mean ± σ):       2.1 ms ±   0.9 ms    [User: 0.8 ms, System: 0.7 ms]
  Range (min … max):     0.7 ms …   8.4 ms    386 runs

Benchmark 4: python3 examples/bench_flask.py
  Time (mean ± σ):      57.6 ms ±   2.3 ms    [User: 46.6 ms, System: 7.0 ms]
  Range (min … max):    54.5 ms …  64.4 ms    49 runs
