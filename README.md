# PyAOT

**v0.1.0-alpha** - Early development, not production-ready

Python to Zig AOT compiler. Write Python, run native code.

**Up to 27x faster** than CPython | Native binaries | Zero runtime overhead

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/teamchong/zyth pyaot
cd pyaot
make install

# Compile and run
pyaot examples/fibonacci.py
```

## Installation

**Requirements:**
- Zig 0.15.2 or later

**Install:**
```bash
make install
```

This builds an optimized 433KB binary and installs it to `~/.local/bin/pyaot`.

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

## Usage

```bash
# Compile and run (default: shared library .so)
pyaot your_file.py

# Build standalone binary
pyaot --binary your_file.py

# Force recompilation (ignore cache)
pyaot --force your_file.py

# Build only, don't run
pyaot build your_file.py

# Build standalone binary without running
pyaot build --binary your_file.py
```

### Compilation Modes

**Shared Library (.so) - Default:**
- Fast compilation
- Smaller output size
- Architecture-specific naming (e.g., `myapp_x86_64.so`, `myapp_arm64.so`)
- Timestamp-based caching for faster rebuilds

**Standalone Binary (--binary):**
- Fully self-contained executable
- No dependencies
- Slightly larger size
- Portable within same architecture

## Examples

### 1. Computational (Fibonacci)

Fast recursive computation - **14x faster** than CPython.

```python
def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

result = fibonacci(35)
print(result)  # 9227465
```

```bash
pyaot examples/fibonacci.py
# Output: 9227465 (in 59ms vs CPython's 842ms)
```

### 2. Object-Oriented (Class Inheritance)

Full OOP support with classes and inheritance.

```python
class Shape:
    def __init__(self, x: int, y: int):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, x: int, y: int, width: int, height: int):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self) -> int:
        return self.width * self.height

rect = Rectangle(10, 20, 5, 3)
print(rect.area())  # 15
```

### 3. List Processing

List comprehensions with filtering.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
filtered = [x for x in numbers if x > 2]
print(filtered)  # [3, 4, 5]

# List methods
numbers.append(6)
numbers.reverse()
print(numbers)
```

### 4. String Operations

String manipulation - **8x faster** than CPython.

```python
text = "Hello, World!"
upper = text.upper()
words = text.split(", ")
print(upper)     # HELLO, WORLD!
print(words[0])  # Hello

# String methods: upper, lower, split, strip, replace, find, count
```

## Performance

Benchmarked with [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) on macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon).

All benchmarks run ~60 seconds on CPython for statistical significance.

| Benchmark | CPython | PyPy | PyAOT | vs CPython | vs PyPy |
|:----------|--------:|-----:|------:|-----------:|--------:|
| **Loop Sum (1.4B)** | ~60s | 2.1s | 1.5s | **28x faster** 🚀 | **1.4x faster** |
| **Fibonacci(45)** | ~60s | 7.6s | 4.4s | **14x faster** 🚀 | **1.7x faster** |
| **String Concat (650M)** | ~60s | 1.5s | TBD | **TBD** | TBD |

**Performance highlights:**
- **Loop sum:** 28x faster than CPython, 1.4x faster than PyPy
- **Recursive fibonacci:** 14x faster than CPython, 1.7x faster than PyPy
- **Range:** 14-28x speedup vs CPython on computational tasks
- **AOT vs JIT:** PyAOT beats PyPy's JIT compiler on most benchmarks

**Why PyAOT is faster:**
- Direct compilation to native machine code via Zig (no interpreter)
- Eliminates Python interpreter overhead completely
- Native i64 in CPU registers vs PyLongObject heap allocations
- Zero dynamic dispatch - direct function calls
- No GC pauses or JIT warmup time
- AOT compilation (no warmup needed unlike PyPy's JIT)

**Run benchmarks:**
```bash
./benchmarks/run_benchmarks.sh  # Compares CPython vs PyPy vs PyAOT
```

**Key insights:**
- PyAOT excels at CPU-bound tasks with heavy function call overhead
- Best suited for recursive algorithms, computational loops, and integer arithmetic
- Zero runtime overhead - binaries are pre-compiled
- Faster than PyPy's JIT on most computational workloads
- All benchmarks measure runtime only (no compilation time included)

### 📋 Roadmap

**Phase 1: Essential Libraries (Next 4 weeks)**
- [✓] JSON support (`import json`) - Critical for real apps
  - Use Zig's `std.json` (fast, zero-copy parsing)
  - Comptime schema optimization for known structures
- [ ] File I/O operations (open, read, write)
  - Direct syscalls (Bun-style, no libuv overhead)
  - Memory-mapped I/O for large files
  - Zero-copy reads where possible
- [ ] Basic HTTP client (sync only) - For API calls
  - Fast connection pooling

  - Seamless workflow: `uv pip install package` → `pyaot app.py`
  - PyAOT focuses on runtime, uv handles packages (best tool for each job)
  - Optional: `pyaot install` as wrapper around uv
  - Why not build our own: uv is 10-100x faster than pip, Rust-based, well-funded team
- [ ] Fast I/O primitives (Bun-inspired)
  - Direct syscalls (bypass Python's I/O layers)
  - Memory-mapped file operations
  - Zero-copy networking
  - Batch file operations
  - **Core competency**: PyAOT controls Python I/O performance
- [ ] Compiled binary caching
  - Cache at `~/.pyaot/cache/` for instant re-runs
  - Hash-based cache invalidation
  - Share compiled binaries across projects
- [ ] Single binary distribution
  - All-in-one installer: `curl -fsSL https://pyaot.sh | sh`
  - Contains: runtime + compiler + profiler + model tools
  - Professional distribution (Bun-style)
- [ ] pyaot.http (async HTTP client)
  - Connection pooling per domain
  - HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support
  - Automatic retry and backoff
- [ ] pyaot.web (FastAPI-compatible web server)
  - Native async (no WSGI overhead)

  - Connection pooling built-in

**Phase 3: Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO)**
- [ ] Lightweight profiling (`pyaot --profile app.py`)
  - Branch frequency counters (1-2% overhead)
  - Function call counts
  - Data distribution tracking

  - Buffer size optimization (right-sized allocations)
  - Hot path specialization (fast paths for 80% cases)
  - Dead code elimination (remove unused branches)
  - **Specialized HTTP clients** (optimize for frequently-called APIs)
    - Example: 95% requests to GitHub API → generate optimized GitHub client
    - Connection pooling for hot domains
    - Pre-parsed response structures
- [ ] Continuous optimization (self-improving runtime)
  - Week 1: Generic compilation
  - Week 2+: Profile-optimized (30-500% faster)
  - Auto-recompile when profile changes significantly
